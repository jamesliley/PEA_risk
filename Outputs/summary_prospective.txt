 Wilcoxon rank-sum test comparing model-derived predictions for individuals who died post-PEA with predictions for individuals who did not

	Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction

data:  Ypv[which(Yv == 1)] and Ypv[which(Yv == 0)]
W = 4365, p-value = 0.003869
alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0
